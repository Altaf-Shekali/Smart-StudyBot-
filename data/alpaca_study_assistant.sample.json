        "output": "Answer: Big O notation describes how an algorithm's runtime or space grows with input size.\nExplanation: It abstracts constant factors and lower-order terms, focusing on worst-case growth (e.g., O(n), O(n log n)).\nExample: Linear search is O(n) because time grows proportionally with the number of elements.\nSource: Course notes (Algorithms Intro)."

Insertions are O(n) in arrays (worst case) vs O(1) with a known node in linked lists.\nExplanation: Arrays are contiguous so index access is constant; linked lists must traverse nodes. Insertions at known positions are cheap in linked lists.\nExample: Insert at head: array O(n) (shift), singly linked list O(1) (re-link).\nSource: Data Structures overview."
